Sourcemeta is an open-source organization. As such, it accepts and appreciates
external contributions. These involve code, documentation, design, or any other
type of changes that improve our projects in any way. Also check out the
[resources]({{< ref "resources" >}}) page for useful material that can help you
make contributions.

Developer Certificate of Origin
-------------------------------

To ensure suitability of proposed changes from an intellectual property point
of view, every Sourcemeta project enforces the [Developer Certificate of Origin
(DCO)](https://developercertificate.org). This is a statement introduced by the
Linux Foundation to ensure the contributor is allowed to make the contribution
and that the project has the right to distribute it under its license.

From a contributor point of view, the Developer Certificate of Origin requires
you to sign-off your [Git](https://git-scm.com) commits. You can automatically
do this using the
[`--signoff`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---signoff)
command-line flag.

Grant of Rights
---------------

By contributing to any open-source project hosted by Sourcemeta, the
Contributor irrevocably assigns, transfers, and conveys to the organization all
right, title, and interest in and to any contributions, including, but not
limited to, all intellectual property rights.

The contributor acknowledges and agrees that Sourcemeta shall have the
exclusive right to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, sublicense, and otherwise exploit the contributions, whether
in original or modified form, for any purpose and without any obligation to
account to the contributor.

The contributor grants Sourcemeta the right to re-license the contributions,
including any derivative works, under other licenses as Sourcemeta deems
appropriate.

Code of Conduct
---------------

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at hello@sourcemeta.com. All complaints
will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated
to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
